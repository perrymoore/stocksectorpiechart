# stocksectorpiechart
Uses matplotlib, pandas, and yfinance to create a pie chart of the sectors a given portfolio is invested in
I wrote this code in response to a friends excel sheet where they would input manually the tickers, share price, and quantity of their shares to create a pie chart.
I figured automating this with YFinance would be a valuable lesson in coding and could bring the potential to have something like this run independently.
